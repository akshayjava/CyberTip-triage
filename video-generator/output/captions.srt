00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,900
The tip volume problem

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,900
Real-time operational picture

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,650
Every incoming tip is scored by AI

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,400
and assigned a priority tier — from

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,150
standard up to P1 Critical for active

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,900
victim situations.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,900
One-click critical filter

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,233
Select the first tip. The detail pane

9
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,567
shows the NCMEC report data, AI analysis,

10
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:34,900
and circuit-specific legal guidance.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,233
The tier badge reflects the scoring rationale

12
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,567
— here, age indicators and distress language

13
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:41,900
elevated this to P1 Critical.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,900
Wilson v. Jessup compliance

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,900
The system enforces this automatically. No investigator

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,900
can accidentally open a blocked file.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,233
Legal notes are generated per tip, citing

18
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,567
your circuit's case law. This language drops

19
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:02,900
directly into your warrant application.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,900
Integrated warrant workflow

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,900
Once the judge grants the warrant, blocked

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,900
files unblock automatically. Full chain of custody

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,900
is logged.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,900
Bundle deduplication

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,900
