00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,900
The tip volume problem

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,900
Real-time operational overview

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,650
Every incoming tip is scored by AI

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,400
and assigned a priority tier — from

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,150
Immediate down to Monitor. No more guessing

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,900
what to work first.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,900
Filtering critical tips

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,233
Select the top tip. The detail pane

9
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,567
shows the AI's crisis assessment, subject identifiers,

10
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:34,900
and the ESP's original report data.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,900
Bundle deduplication

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,900
Wilson v. United States compliance

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,900
Files the ESP never viewed are automatically

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,900
blocked. You cannot open them without a

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,900
warrant. The system enforces this — no

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,900
exceptions, no accidental Fourth Amendment violations.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,900
Integrated warrant tracking

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,900
When the warrant is granted, blocked files

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,900
unlock automatically. Full chain of custody is

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,900
logged for court.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,233
Every tip includes circuit-specific legal guidance. The

22
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,567
system identifies your jurisdiction and surfaces relevant

23
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:16,900
case law and procedural requirements.
